		<h3>Research interests</h3>
		My research focuses on Robotic, Algorithms, Data Science and Path planning and Optimization for single and multiple robots and autonomous vehicles. In particular:
		<ul>
		  <li> Optimizing path for single and multiple robots using Determnistic shortcut-based smoothing algorithm and Quadratic Bazier curves providing C1 continuity while controling curvature, length and collision avoidance in continuous envioronments for Multi-Robots</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Course & Projects</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> <b> Single and Multi-agent Path Optimization with Deterministic Shortcuts, Jun 2021 - March 2022, UC Merced </b> <br>
			We generate and develop algorithms using RRT-based path planning application to optimize lanes for Multi-Robots in terms of smoothing and </b> <br>
			shortening lanes/paths which is going to be collision free. Some of these algorithms that are generated include Corner smoothing Method, </b> <br>
			Max Sub-Path Method, Max Shortcut Method, Max- Radius Method, Subdivision Method. <br>
			</li>

			<li> <b> Path optimization with Quadratic Bezier curves in 2D, Jun 2022 -May 2023, UC Merced </b> <br>
			Building on previous work of path optimization for robots using shortcut techniques by implementing curvature constraints <br>
			</li>

			<li> <b> Lane Systems of Max lows, Application: Controlling and Management of Traffic Flow, May 2020-Spring 2021, Jun 2022-May 2023 UC Merced</b> <br>
				This project addresses the determination of lanes for multi-agent systems. I describe three variations of lane-based multi-agent problems, and suggest how to approach these problems with a medial axis transform and by employing graph-based max flow algorithms.
				These variations deal with challenges including assigning capacity at vertex points, handling crossing flows, and using multiple sources and sinks. <br>
				</li>
			<li> <b> Modeling a Hierarchical Object | UC Merced-Fall 2019 | Course Project (Computer Graphic) </b> <br>
			Implement Modeling a Hierarchical Object includes 5 parts interconnected by joints produce movements in 3 dimensions with two types of global and joint motion.<br>
			tools - CPP, Open GL <br>			
			</li>
			
			<li> <b> Animating a Hierarchical Object | UC Merced-Fall 2019 | Course Project (Computer Graphic) </b> <br>

			tools - CPP, Open GL <br>			
			</li>
			
			<li> <b> Baseball Elimination Project | UC Merced-Fall 2019 | Course Project (Advance Algorithm) </b> <br>
			Find which teams have a chance to win Baseball league using MaxFlow Mincut Algorithm <br>
			tools-CPP 
			</li>
			
			<li> <b>Min Spanning Tree (Kruskal, Prim’s algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm and Boruvka algorithm) | UC Denver-Spring 2018 | Course Project (Network Flow) </b> <br>
